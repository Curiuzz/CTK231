            <p><b>Stray Kitten<br>
            By: Christopher Posner</b></p>

            <p>I’m a witness of a crime<br>
            A witness of a burglary<br>
            A witness of a woman<br>
            Who witnessed herself steal her own heart</p>

            <p>She was a beautiful being<br>
            More beautiful than most<br>
            With eyes that shined and sparkled<br>
            Bright like the starlight at night</p>

            <p>She brought with herself a fragrance<br>
            That opened up a new world<br>
            She put on 50 bottles of perfume<br>
            Nobody knew her natural scent<br>
            Only the flowery one that was carried with her<br>
            So she could hide herself better</p>

            <p>She broke the mirror in her life<br>
            Her glasses cracked in half<br>
            But mine didn’t</p>

            <p>If only 1 of 100 say something hurtful<br>
            She listens to the one<br>
            The smallest things would bug her<br>
            Like she had OCD<br>
            But only when she thought about herself</p>

            <p>As she lost touch with her outside<br>
            She lost touch with her inside too<br>
            Every day<br>
            Bit by bit<br>
            From her stomach to her trash<br>
            She lost her hunger<br>
            She lost herself too</p>

            <p>Her book was left shut<br>
            Nobody could add to it<br>
            Only her own dark thoughts<br>
            Were added to the pages</p>

            <p>Her world went from day to night<br>
            Just during the day<br>
            Her mind, the fluctuating stock market<br>
            Not knowing when to buy or sell</p>

            <p>So she bought the bad opinions<br>
            Mostly from herself<br>
            And took her life away<br>
            Beauty, unknown yet clear<br>
            Gone with her</p>

            <p>I wish she knew<br>
            I wished she would look at herself different<br>
            I’m not religious, but I prayed<br>
            I prayed she wouldn’t give up<br>
            I prayed she would stay</p>

            <p>Cute as a puppy<br>
            Pretty as a butterfly<br>
            But she was misplaced<br>
            She was in the lost and found<br>
            As I look back<br>
            It’s clear to me now<br>
            She was a stray kitten<br>
            Beautiful and lost</p>

            <p>I’m a witness of a crime<br>
            A crime a girl committed on herself<br>
            If only she knew that 5 extra pounds<br>
            Didn’t stop her from being the most beautiful person in the room</p>
