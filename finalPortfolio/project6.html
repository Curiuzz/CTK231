            <p><b>The Ladder<br>
            By: Christopher Posner</b></p>

            <p>What would younger me say<br>
            If I told him I got saved<br>
            I got saved from the past<br>
            I got saved from the pain</p>

            <p>What would younger me say<br>
            If I told him I haven’t changed<br>
            I’m still stuck in the past<br>
            I’m still haunted by the pain</p>

            <p>When you spend 5 years trying<br>
            To cope with your scars<br>
            To cope with your wounds<br>
            To let down your guard<br>
            Is it crazy that a surgery can’t even help?</p>

            <p>When you spend 5 years dying<br>
            Falling so far down a hole<br>
            As far down as the pain in your nerves<br>
            Is it crazy that a ladder can’t even help?</p>

            <p>If I told you how it feels<br>
            To resist the tears forming in your eyes<br>
            Hoping for something to ease the pain<br>
            Would you sympathize?</p>

            <p>If I told you how it feels<br>
            To stand alone with your broken spine<br>
            And hope the pain wouldn’t flare up<br>
            Would you stand by my side?</p>

            <p>If I woke up<br>
            And my skin was pale and green<br>
            And I walked with both hands<br>
            Stretched out in front of me<br>
            Would I be any different?</p>

            <p>What would future me say<br>
            If I told him I wanted to stay this way<br>
            Would he beg me to wake up?<br>
            Would he beg me to change?</p>

            <p>I was handed the ladder<br>
            When I was so far down<br>
            How do you expect me to climb up now?</p>

            <p>But I was handed the ladder<br>
            When I needed it most<br>
            So why am I still here?</p>

            <p>I was handed the ladder<br>
            When younger me was fighting<br>
            And for that poor soul<br>
            Step by step, I’m climbing</p>
