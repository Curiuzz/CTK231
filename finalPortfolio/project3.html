		<p id="intro"><i>The Book Game</i> is a multiplayer board game in which your goal is to escape a haunted library by seeking out books, which give you hints on how to escape. There are 6 different color paths to choose from each game, all offering different bookmarks (powerups), hints, stories, and traps. Landing on book spaces allows you to read a book, which will give you either a bookmark, a hint, a story, or a trap. Reading hints and completing the tasks on them will eventually lead you to escape the library!<br>
        This game was inspired by a game that I made many times with my brother when we were younger, also titled <i>The Book Game</i>. In our version of the game, we would use actual books and lay them out on the floor of our house to create a large board of spaces, and we would use toys as characters to move across the spaces. Every time we made <i>The Book Game</i>, the layout was different, so it was a ton of fun. The game wasn't as fun for our parents, however, who had to avoid tripping on the books scattered across the house. I'm glad I was able to make this game in honor of the game I made with my brother when I was young.
