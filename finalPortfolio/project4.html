		<p id="intro"><i>Charmoid Racing</i> is a racing video game in which there are 8 playable characters called Charmoids, and 4 playable tracks. Each Charmoid has their own special ability they can use while racing. The Charmoids' names are Sealdew, Pengy, Volcanine, Mossupial, Grumblin, Salemouse, Orbidragon, and Platyzap. The names of the 4 tracks are Charmoid Stadium, Volcanine Volcano, Mossupial Meadow, and Orbital Raceway. These racetracks can be played together in order in Tournament Mode. In Tournament Mode, you gain points based on your placement in each track, and if you score the most points, you win a gold trophy. If you come in first in every race, you get a platinum trophy instead. Trophies count toward each Charmoid, so to achieve full completion of the game you have to get a platinum trophy with each of the 8 Charmoids. While coming up with the idea for this game, I felt inspired to create audio tracks for each racetrack. I made these audio tracks on BeepBox, a free-to-use online tool for making instrumental audio files. This was the first time I had ever made audio tracks, and it was very fun to do.</p>
