		<h1><a href="portfolio.html" target="_self">Christopher's Portfolio</a></h1>
		<p id="intro">Hi! My name is Christopher Posner and I'm an aspiring game designer. I am currently enrolled in the game design program at Illinois State University and I'm learning as much as I can about the game design process. I also enjoy writing poems every once in a while, and I figure that writing poems will help with writing stories for games in the future. Below is all of the projects I have worked on during my time in the game design program.</p>
			<div id="row1">
				<section>
					<h2><a href="project1.html" target="_self">Rowed to Glory</a></h2>
					<div class="f-carousel" id="RTGCarousel">
      					<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img class="slides" src="RTG_board.jpg" alt="Board"></div>
      					<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img class="slides" src="RTG_cards.jpg" alt="Cards"></div>
      					<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img class="slides" src="RTG_rulebook.png" alt="Rulebook"></div>
    				</div>
					<p><i>Rowed to Glory</i> is a linear, multiplayer board game in which your goal is to collect the most fish before everybody reaches the end.</p>

					<h2><a href="project3.html" target="_self">The Book Game</a></h2>
					<div class="f-carousel" id="TBGCarousel">
      					<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img class="slides" src="TBGRulebook.png" alt="Rulebook"></div>
      					<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img class="slides" src="TBG1.png" alt="Card"></div>

						<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img class="slides" src="TBG3.png" alt="Card"></div>
    				</div>

				</section>
			</div>
			<div id="row2">
				<section>
					<h2><a href="project4.html" target="_self">Charmoid Racing</a></h2>
					<p><i>Charmoid Racing</i> is a racing video game in which there are 8 playable characters called Charmoids, and 4 playable tracks. Each Charmoid has their own special ability they can use while racing. While coming up with the idea for this game, I felt inspired to create audio tracks for each racetrack.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2><a href="project5.html" target="_self">Stray Kitten</a></h2>
					<p>"Stray Kitten" is a poem I originally wrote during my sophomore year in high school and have since refined. This poem was inspired by a woman I knew who didn't like the way she looked, even though I knew she was beautiful.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2><a href="project6.html" target="_self">The Ladder</a></h2>
					<p>"The Ladder" is a poem I recently wrote, and it very much resonates with me. This poem describes my regret for not feeling happier after my back surgery and getting my life back. I was very depressed in high school because of a crippling back injury, and while I've recovered from it physically, it's hard for me to recover from it mentally.</p>
